2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DSPS-1#1 Error
Invalid PCIN Connection for OPMODE value  
DSP48E1 instance mac0/U0/i_synth/device_supports_dsp.use_multadd_dsp/dsp48_multadd.multadd_usecase_inst/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_vx7.i_uniwrap/i_primitive has OPMODE[5:4] set to 01 which uses the input of the PCIN bus for its computation, however the PCIN input is not properly connected to another DSP48E1 Block.  Please either correct the connectivity or OPMODE value to allow for proper implementation.
Related violations: <none>

DPCA-3#1 Critical Warning
Cascaded cell types  
Invalid connection used for DSP48E1. Unroutable DSP cascade connection to non-DSP cell found. Port PCIN[47:0] of DSP cell mac0/U0/i_synth/device_supports_dsp.use_multadd_dsp/dsp48_multadd.multadd_usecase_inst/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_vx7.i_uniwrap/i_primitive can be driven only by PCOUT port of a different DSP cell.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
79 out of 79 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: T[9:0], valid, ctr_rst, y[7:0], x[7:0], clk, sclr, ce, zout[47:0].
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-1#1 Critical Warning
Unrouted nets  
48 net(s) are unrouted. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are z[47:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
79 out of 79 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: T[9:0], valid, ctr_rst, y[7:0], x[7:0], clk, sclr, ce, zout[47:0].
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gclk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin i[1]_i_2/O, cell i[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT i[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 22 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    cc_reg {FDRE}
    i_reg[0] {FDRE}
    i_reg[0]__0 {FDRE}
    i_reg[1] {FDRE}
    i_reg[1]__0 {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
mac0/U0/i_synth/device_supports_dsp.use_multadd_dsp/dsp48_multadd.multadd_usecase_inst/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_vx7.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>
