\section{Conclusion}
The primary components of the neural net have all been designed, and most have been implemented.  Near future work will include finishing the implementation of the serial convolution layer, finishing parallelized matrix multiplication, and connecting the rest of the layers.  Work must also be done in setting up the radio module for the FPGA, however we have encountered setbacks since the most recent software for the radio module is only compaitive with older version of Vivado.  We believe at this rate we should at least be able to complete the neural net implementation by the end of the semester.
