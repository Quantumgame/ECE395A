\section{Abstract}
We provide a description of contributions made by Cory Nezin to the progress of real time automatic modulation classification using neural networks implemented in hardware.  Key design contributions to be discussed include: design and implementation of time domain multiplexed convolution and matrix multiplication as well as systolic max pooling, arg max, and layer connection logic.  One other contribution is the implementation of simulation verification code.
