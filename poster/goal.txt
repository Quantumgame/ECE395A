# The problem
Modulation is process of varying an electronic signal to transmit information.

There are many different common types of modulation for wireless communication which vary features such as amplitude, phase, and frequency.

Modulation classification is a major task for cognitive radios which change their transmission to maximize efficiency based on what they observe.

# Neural networks
Neural networks, a type of artificial intellignece, have recently been suggested as a method of automatically classifying wireless signal modulation.

# FPGAs
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been used extensively in the fields of digital signal processing and wireless communicaiton.

Our project combines these two technologies.  MAIA is a hardware architecture tailor-made for neural networks.  MAIA utilizes neural networks to achieve high accuracy, and FPGAs to achieve high speed and low power consumption
